If a neuron activates, then it means the input is important.  The are different kinds of activation functions. The choice of which activation function to use depends on what you want the output to be. Another important role of an activation function is to add non-linearity to the model.\n",

As an input enters the neuron, it gets multiplied by a weight value and the resulting output is either observed, or passed to the next layer in the neural network. Weights for all neurons in a layer are organized into one tensor\n",
